                AWS VPC


4. Core Architecture Components
4.1 AWS VPC

The AWS VPC provides the primary network boundary for cloud workloads.

The VPC is logically divided into:

Public subnets
Private application subnets
Private database subnets
Route tables
Internet Gateway
NAT Gateway
Security Groups
Network ACLs

Private workloads are isolated from direct internet access wherever possible.

4.2 Application Load Balancer

The Application Load Balancer provides the entry point for application traffic.

Responsibilities include:

Distributing HTTP/HTTPS requests.
Routing traffic to healthy application instances.
Performing health checks.
Supporting highly available application deployment across Availability Zones.
Providing a controlled entry point for the application tier.
4.3 EC2 and Auto Scaling

The application tier is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances managed through an Auto Scaling Group.

The design supports:

Multiple application instances.
Multi-AZ deployment.
Automatic replacement of unhealthy instances.
Horizontal scaling based on workload demand.
Integration with the Application Load Balancer.

The application tier remains inside private subnets where direct inbound internet access is not required.

4.4 Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL represents the managed database tier.

The design provides:

Managed database operations.
Private database connectivity.
Multi-AZ availability considerations.
Automated backup capabilities.
Controlled access from the application tier.
Separation between application and database networks.

Database access should be restricted through security groups and least-privilege connectivity rules.

4.5 Amazon S3

Amazon S3 provides object storage for appropriate application data and supporting artifacts.

Potential uses include:

Application objects.
Backup data.
Static assets.
Logs or exported data.
Migration-related storage.

Access should be controlled using IAM policies, bucket policies, encryption, and appropriate public-access restrictions.

5. Hybrid Connectivity

The architecture maintains connectivity between the existing on-premises environment and AWS.

The connectivity layer can use:

AWS Site-to-Site VPN for encrypted connectivity.
AWS Direct Connect as a dedicated connectivity option for suitable enterprise requirements.
BGP for dynamic route exchange where applicable.
AWS Transit Gateway for centralized network connectivity.

The final connectivity mechanism depends on business requirements, traffic volume, latency requirements, availability requirements, and cost considerations.

6. Security Architecture

Security is implemented as multiple control layers rather than relying on a single security mechanism.

Identity and Access
IAM roles and policies.
Least-privilege access.
MFA for privileged access.
Role-based access control.
Separation of administrative and workload permissions.
Network Security
Public/private subnet separation.
Security Groups.
Network ACLs.
Network Firewall where required.
Restricted inbound and outbound traffic.
Private database connectivity.
Data Protection
Encryption at rest using AWS encryption services.
TLS for data in transit.
Controlled access to S3 objects.
Managed database encryption where applicable.
Security Monitoring
AWS CloudTrail.
Amazon GuardDuty.
AWS Config.
Amazon CloudWatch.
Application and infrastructure logs.
7. High Availability

The target architecture uses multiple Availability Zones for critical application components.

The intended availability model is:

                    Application Traffic
                           |
                           v
                         ALB
                      /       \
                     /         \
                    v           v
                 AZ-A         AZ-B
               EC2/ASG      EC2/ASG
                    \         /
                     \       /
                       RDS

This design reduces dependency on a single Availability Zone and supports workload continuity when an individual instance or Availability Zone becomes unavailable.

The project target considers an availability objective of 99.99%, subject to implementation, service configuration, and operational validation.

8. Disaster Recovery and Multi-Region Design

The primary workload is designed for a multi-AZ architecture within the primary AWS Region.

For regional-level disaster recovery, a secondary AWS Region can be maintained according to the required recovery strategy.

The DR design considers:

Database replication or backup-based recovery.
Cross-region data protection.
Infrastructure recreation through Terraform.
Application deployment automation.
DNS-based traffic recovery.
Recovery procedures and validation.

Target recovery objectives:

RTO: Less than 1 hour.
RPO: Less than 15 minutes.

These targets are architectural objectives and require actual implementation and testing before they can be considered achieved.

9. Monitoring and Operations

The target architecture includes centralized operational visibility.

Monitoring areas include:

EC2 CPU, memory, and disk utilization.
Application health.
ALB request count and target health.
HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses.
RDS CPU utilization and database connections.
Network traffic.
Application logs.
Infrastructure logs.
Security events.
Availability and recovery events.

AWS CloudWatch is the primary AWS-native monitoring component, with Prometheus and Grafana considered where deeper metrics collection and visualization are required.

10. Infrastructure Automation

Terraform is used where infrastructure automation is applicable.

The intended approach includes:

Terraform Configuration
        |
        v
Terraform Modules
        |
        v
Infrastructure Plan
        |
        v
Validation
        |
        v
Controlled Deployment
        |
        v
AWS Infrastructure

Infrastructure should be maintained as code to improve:

Repeatability.
Version control.
Configuration consistency.
Reviewability.
Environment management.
Recovery and reconstruction capability.
11. Cost and Governance

The architecture considers cost as part of infrastructure design.

Key practices include:

Resource tagging.
Rightsizing.
Monitoring resource utilization.
Budget controls.
Lifecycle management for storage.
Appropriate compute purchasing strategies.
Removal of unused resources.
Environment separation.
Infrastructure change tracking.

Cost optimization should be balanced with availability, performance, security, and business requirements.

Security, monitoring, logging, governance, and identity controls operate across the architecture.

13. Architecture Design Principles

The target architecture follows these principles:

Security by Design – security controls are incorporated into network, identity, application, and data layers.
Least Privilege – users and workloads receive only the permissions required for their responsibilities.
High Availability – critical workloads are distributed across Availability Zones.
Automation First – infrastructure configuration is managed through Infrastructure as Code where applicable.
Loose Coupling – application components are separated to reduce dependency and simplify scaling.
Observability – infrastructure and application behavior should be measurable and traceable.
Cost Awareness – resource selection and scaling should consider operational cost.
Recoverability – infrastructure and application components should support backup and disaster recovery requirements.
Incremental Migration – workloads should be migrated according to business criticality, dependencies, and migration readiness.
14. Implementation Status

The architecture described in this document represents the proposed target state for the project.

Implemented infrastructure, configurations, Terraform code, and validation evidence are documented separately in the repository where applicable.

Components that have not been deployed or validated are presented as proposed, reference, or future implementation architecture and should not be interpreted as production deployment results.
