# Disaster Recovery Design

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the proposed disaster recovery architecture for the **Enterprise Cloud Migration and Hybrid Architecture Design** project.

The disaster recovery design focuses on maintaining business continuity and enabling recovery of critical workloads during infrastructure, Availability Zone, or regional failures.

> **Architecture Status:** Proposed / Reference Disaster Recovery Design  
> The recovery architecture and objectives described here are design targets. They should not be interpreted as completed disaster recovery implementation unless supported by deployment and testing evidence.

---

## 2. Disaster Recovery Objectives

The DR architecture is designed to:

- Reduce the impact of infrastructure failures.
- Support recovery from Availability Zone failures.
- Provide a strategy for regional-level disaster recovery.
- Protect application and database data.
- Support infrastructure reconstruction using Infrastructure as Code.
- Provide defined recovery objectives.
- Establish controlled recovery and failover procedures.
- Support periodic recovery validation and testing.

---

## 3. Recovery Objectives

The project defines the following target recovery objectives:

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Availability | 99.99% |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Less than 1 hour |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | Less than 15 minutes |
| Architecture | Multi-AZ + Multi-Region |
| Primary Cloud Platform | AWS |

These are architectural targets and require actual implementation, monitoring, and recovery testing before they can be considered achieved.

---

## 4. Disaster Recovery Architecture

The proposed architecture uses the primary AWS Region for normal operations and considers a secondary AWS Region for regional disaster recovery.

                    DNS
                      |

          v                       v
       AZ-A                     AZ-B

          |                       |
          +-----------+-----------+
                      |
                      v
                RDS PostgreSQL
                      |
                      |
              Backup / Replication
                      |
                      v
             SECONDARY AWS REGION
                      |
               Recovery Stack
                      |
                      v
              Application Recovery

```
The secondary region remains a recovery environment whose implementation model depends on workload criticality, RTO, RPO, cost, and recovery requirements.

## 5. Multi-AZ Resilience

High availability within the primary AWS Region is achieved by distributing critical workloads across multiple Availability Zones.

The application architecture considers:

```text
                    Application Traffic
                           |
                           v
                          ALB
                       /       \
                      /         \
                     v           v
                  AZ-A         AZ-B
                EC2 / ASG    EC2 / ASG
                     \         /
                      \       /
                        RDS

This reduces dependency on a single Availability Zone.

A failure of an individual application instance should be handled through health checks and Auto Scaling where configured.

```
## 6. Multi-Region Disaster Recovery

For regional-level failures, a secondary AWS Region can be used as the recovery environment.

The conceptual model is:

```text
PRIMARY REGION
      |
      | Data / Configuration Protection
      v
SECONDARY REGION
      |
      v
Recovery Infrastructure
      |
      v
Application Recovery

The secondary region may contain:

Recovery infrastructure.
Required network configuration.
Application deployment configuration.
Database recovery mechanisms.
Required storage and backup data.
Monitoring and operational configuration.
DNS or traffic recovery mechanisms.

The exact recovery architecture should be selected according to business requirements and workload criticality.

```
## 7. Data Protection

Data protection is a central component of the disaster recovery strategy.

The architecture considers:

- Database backups.
- Database replication where required.
- Cross-region data protection.
- Amazon S3 backup and object protection.
- Encryption of protected data.
- Backup retention requirements.
- Recovery validation.

The selected mechanism should be aligned with the required RPO.
8. Database Recovery

## 8. Database Recovery

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is considered the primary database architecture.

The DR strategy may use:

- Automated backups.
- Point-in-time recovery.
- Multi-AZ database deployment.
- Cross-region replication where required.
- Snapshot-based recovery.
- Recovery testing.

Conceptual flow:

```text
Primary RDS
     |
     +----> Backup
     |
     +----> Replication / Data Protection
                    |
                    v
              DR Region
                    |
                    v
             Recovery RDS

The final database recovery mechanism depends on the required RTO, RPO, workload characteristics, and cost considerations.
```

## 9. Application Recovery

Application recovery should be supported through automation rather than manual infrastructure recreation wherever possible.

The recovery process considers:

```text
Application Configuration
          |
          v
Infrastructure as Code
          |
          v
Terraform
          |
          v
Recovery Infrastructure
          |
          v
Application Deployment
          |
          v
Application Validation

Application deployment automation can reduce recovery time and improve consistency between the primary and recovery environments.

```
## 10. Infrastructure Recovery Using Terraform

Terraform can be used to define the infrastructure required for recovery.

The approach provides:

- Repeatable infrastructure creation.
- Version-controlled configuration.
- Consistent environment definitions.
- Reduced manual configuration.
- Faster infrastructure reconstruction.
- Recovery support for cloud resources.

The recovery environment should be tested periodically to ensure that the Terraform configuration remains usable for disaster recovery.
11. DNS and Traffic Recovery

## 11. DNS and Traffic Recovery

DNS can be used as part of the regional recovery mechanism.

Conceptually:

```text
                    DNS
                     |
              +------+------+
              |             |
              v             v
        Primary Region   DR Region
              |             |
              v             v
        Application      Recovery
          Stack            Stack
```

During a regional recovery event, DNS-based traffic management can redirect users toward the recovery environment where the required infrastructure and application services are available.

The exact mechanism depends on the selected DNS architecture and recovery strategy.
``

## 12. Recovery Scenarios

The DR design considers multiple failure scenarios.

### Scenario 1 — Application Instance Failure

```text
Unhealthy EC2 Instance
          |
          v
ALB Health Check
          |
          v
Instance Removed
          |
          v
Auto Scaling
          |
          v
Replacement Instance

The objective is to maintain application availability without requiring regional recovery.

Scenario 2 — Availability Zone Failure

AZ-A Failure
     |
     v
Traffic Directed to
Healthy Resources
     |
     v
AZ-B Application Tier

The multi-AZ architecture is intended to reduce the impact of an individual Availability Zone failure.

Scenario 3 — Regional Failure
Primary Region Failure
          |
          v
Recovery Decision
          |
          v
Activate / Recover DR Region
          |
          v
Restore Application and Data
          |
          v
DNS / Traffic Recovery
          |
          v
Application Validation

Regional recovery should follow a documented and tested recovery procedure.

```

## 13. Recovery Process

The proposed recovery process is:

```text
1. Detect Failure
       |
       v
2. Assess Impact
       |
       v
3. Initiate Recovery Procedure
       |
       v
4. Recover Infrastructure
       |
       v
5. Recover Application
       |
       v
6. Recover / Validate Data
       |
       v
7. Redirect Traffic
       |
       v
8. Validate Application
       |
       v
9. Monitor Recovery Environment

Each step should have documented responsibilities, prerequisites, validation criteria, and rollback considerations.

```
## 14. Backup and Recovery Strategy

The backup strategy should consider:

- Backup frequency.
- Retention period.
- Encryption.
- Backup integrity.
- Cross-region protection.
- Recovery testing.
- Data restoration procedures.

A backup should not be considered a complete DR solution unless the organization can successfully restore and validate the protected workload.
15. RTO and RPO Considerations
## 15. RTO and RPO Considerations

### Recovery Time Objective

**RTO** represents the maximum acceptable time required to restore service following a disruption.

Project target:

**RTO < 1 hour**

The architecture supports this target through:

- Automated infrastructure provisioning.
- Application deployment automation.
- Multi-AZ architecture.
- Predefined recovery procedures.
- Appropriate recovery infrastructure.

### Recovery Point Objective

**RPO** represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

Project target:

**RPO < 15 minutes**

The architecture considers:

- Frequent backups.
- Data replication where required.
- Cross-region protection.
- Recovery validation.

Actual RTO and RPO performance must be measured through controlled testing.
16. Disaster Recovery Testing
## 16. Disaster Recovery Testing

The DR architecture should be periodically tested.

Testing should include:

- Application recovery.
- Database restoration.
- Infrastructure recreation.
- DNS recovery.
- Data integrity validation.
- Connectivity validation.
- Security control validation.
- RTO measurement.
- RPO measurement.

A simplified testing cycle is:

```text
Plan
  |
  v
Simulate Failure
  |
  v
Execute Recovery
  |
  v
Validate Services
  |
  v
Measure RTO / RPO
  |
  v
Document Results
  |
  v
Improve Recovery Plan

```
## 17. Failback Strategy

After the primary environment has been restored, workloads may need to be moved back from the recovery environment.

The conceptual failback process is:

```text
DR Environment
      |
      v
Primary Environment Restored
      |
      v
Data Synchronization
      |
      v
Application Validation
      |
      v
Traffic Reconfiguration
      |
      v
Primary Environment

Failback should only be performed after confirming infrastructure health, data consistency, application readiness, and operational stability.
```

## 18. Disaster Recovery Design Principles

The architecture follows these principles:

1. **Resilience** – Distribute critical workloads across failure domains.
2. **Recoverability** – Maintain the ability to restore infrastructure and application services.
3. **Data Protection** – Protect critical data through backups and replication where required.
4. **Automation** – Use Infrastructure as Code and deployment automation to reduce manual recovery effort.
5. **Testability** – Recovery procedures should be tested rather than assumed to work.
6. **Defined Objectives** – Recovery procedures should be aligned with RTO and RPO requirements.
7. **Controlled Failover** – Traffic should be redirected through documented and validated mechanisms.
8. **Continuous Improvement** – Recovery procedures should be reviewed and improved based on testing results.
